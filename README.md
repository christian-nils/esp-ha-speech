# esp-ha-speech: Local Speech Recognition on an ESP32
This repository provides the codes to do hot-word detection and speech recognition on an ESP32, fully on-device!

(Based on the Espressif example in [`esp-box`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-box))

This project is still in its infancy, but already it can do hotword detection, speech recognition, and sending speech to Home Assistant. At the moment the hotword is set to "Hi, ESP". The speech commands are fully customisable and can be added using MQTT. Text processing is handled either by Home Assistant's built-in text conversation integration, or by Rhasspy.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
  1. Home Assistant (>=2023.3)
  2. ESP-BOX
  3. MQTT
  4. Rhasspy (optional)

To get started please copy secrets_template.h to secrets.h and edit the variables in there. After that you can flash your ESP-BOX using esptool. I recommend using the Visual Studio Code ESP-IDF plugin as it installs all the required programs for you and flashed the device seamlessly. After that you can connect the device to your network by connecting to the hotspot it creates and filling in the network details.

## Managing voice commands
As of now voice commands can be sending MQTT messages to the `esp-ha/config/add_cmd` topic. As data you should provide a json like this: `{"text": "<your voice command>", "phonetic": "<phonetic voice command"}`. The `text` entry is the command you would like to send to Home Assistant/Rhasspy for recognition. The `phonetic` entry is the phonetic version of it. This phonetic version can be generated using the following python command `python esp-ha\managed_components\espressif__esp-sr\tool\multinet_g2p.py -t <your voice command>`.

To delete all existing commands send an MQTT message to `esp-ha/config/rm_all` with payload `{"confirm": "yes"}`. Note that there are now no voice commands in the system, thus trying to invoke the wake word will result in a crash.
